# Hello_World
I'm trying out Deno 2.0 and a purely TS web developement workflow.

This is a repository to break code and learn.

I'm using the examples from the JS course https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/
and modifing the JS files into TS with the constrains provided by Deno.

The workflow inclues JS files served by Deno filtering (or transpiling TS).
The only JS you will find in this project is automatically created by Deno from TS files.
